This release of strapi-sea can be used for Strapi version <RELEASE>.

The `strapi-app-<platform>-<arch>.zip` files in the release have no real usage / logic they are only here do demonstrate the automatic generation of the SEA binaries for all systems.

To apply the needed changes to make your Strapi application SEA compatible you can apply the patch file with `git apply strapi-sea-v<RELEASE>.patch` or do the manual actions show in the [README](README.md#1.-Prepare-your-project)
